## Overview
<p>The premise of the game is to guess the word selected by the computer at the start of the game. With each guess you come closer to either winning or losing. </p>

## About
<p>As the user continues to guess, the letters reveal themselves and the letter guessed dissapears. Be careful as you only have 6 guesses before you lose, but don't worry you can continue to guess until you get it correct. </p>
